/**
 * Index computation: robust aggregation and outlier rejection.
 *
 * Issues #652 and #653. The price index is built from crowdsourced
 * observations, which means the input is adversarial by default: anyone can
 * submit a number, and a single absurd submission (a rent figure 1000x the
 * real one, a price in the wrong unit) moves a plain mean far more than it
 * moves reality. Two properties are needed:
 *
 *   - **Consistent central value** (#652). A median, not a mean: the median is
 *     the value that splits the sample in half, so up to half the observations
 *     can be arbitrarily wrong before it moves at all. A mean, by contrast,
 *     moves linearly with any single contribution.
 *   - **Explicit exclusion rules** (#653). Outliers and invalid records are
 *     removed *before* aggregation and excluded from the canonical index, and
 *     every decision is recorded so it can be reviewed and debugged.
 *
 * Why a median and not a trimmed mean: both resist outliers, but the median
 * needs no tuning parameter, is exactly reproducible with integer arithmetic
 * (see below), and has a bounded breakdown point of 50% — the highest possible.
 * A trimmed mean requires choosing how much to trim, and that choice is
 * arbitrary; a 10% trim tolerates 10% corruption, a 40% trim tolerates 40% but
 * discards 40% of good data.
 *
 * Everything here is integer arithmetic. Prices are the contract's `i128` in the
 * smallest fixed-point unit, so they are `bigint` here. Floating point is
 * avoided throughout, for two reasons: `Number` cannot represent integers
 * beyond 2^53-1, which a scaled token price can exceed, and a median that
 * rounds differently on two runs is not reproducible.
 *
 * The functions are pure and total: the same input set always produces the same
 * output, which is what lets #654 serve a stored aggregate and recompute an
 * identical one.
