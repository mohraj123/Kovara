/**
 * HTTP-level checks for the moderation endpoints (issue #645).
 *
 * The store's transition rules are unit-tested in
 * `verification/__tests__/moderation.test.ts`; what matters here is that the
 * route layer maps them onto the right status codes — in particular that an
 * illegal transition is a 409 and not a 400, since a 400 tells the client its
 * request was malformed when in fact it was well-formed and simply not
 * currently allowed.
