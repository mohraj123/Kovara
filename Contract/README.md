# Soroban Contract Workspace (CT-001)

The four Kovara Soroban contracts, as a reproducible Rust Cargo workspace:

| Contract | Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PriceVault | `kovara-price-vault` | Stores raw price submissions keyed by `(country_iso, category, timestamp)` |
| SentinelPool | `kovara-sentinel-pool` | Manages verifier staking, quorum logic, and slashing |
| FlowRewards | `kovara-flow-rewards` | Releases XLM / Stellar USDC to verified submitters and verifiers |
| KovaraIndex | `kovara-index` | Aggregates verified prices into the daily `KVI` per country |

## Prerequisites

- Rust **stable** (1.84+ recommended; the Soroban environment supports 1.82+)
- The appropriate WebAssembly build target:
  - Rust 1.82+: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
  - Rust 1.81 or earlier: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- `soroban-cli` (for deploying, optional for plain builds):
  ```sh
  cargo install --locked stellar-cli
  ```

## Build

Build the whole workspace, passing the target matching your toolchain (the
`.cargo/config.toml` sets the matching linker flags automatically):

```sh
# Rust 1.82+
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none

# Rust 1.81 or earlier
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Build a single contract:

```sh
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none -p kovara-index
```

The `.wasm` artifacts land in `target/<target>/release/`.

For the first-time dependency resolution / reproducible lockfile:

```sh
cargo generate-lockfile
# after a lockfile is present, `--locked` bakes reproducibility in:
cargo build --release --locked --target wasm32v1-none
```

## Test

```sh
cargo test
```

## Lint / format

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --release --target wasm32v1-none -- -D warnings
```

## Deploy (Testnet)

With `soroban-cli` installed (which selects the matching build target for you):

```sh
soroban contract build
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/kovara_index.wasm \
  --network testnet
```

Use the `kovara-index` contract address reported by the command as the
`CONTRACT_ID` for the indexer backend.
